/**
 * Mania scroll model - osu!stable behaviour.
 *
 * Scroll speed at a moment in time is:
 *     speed(t) = (bpm(t) / baseBpm) * sv(t)
 *
 * - baseBpm is the map's nominal BPM, i.e. the BPM of the beat length that
 *   covers the most time (the parser computes this as `beatmap.bpm`). The bulk
 *   of the map scrolls at "1x" and tempo changes scroll proportionally faster /
 *   slower (a 2x-BPM section scrolls twice as fast). Stable does scale scroll
 *   speed by BPM - this is *not* a lazer-only behaviour.
 * - sv(t) is the inherited ("green line") slider-velocity multiplier, clamped
 *   to [0.1, 10] exactly like osu!stable. The previous code used the *unclamped*
 *   value (`scrollSpeedUnlimited`), which is the lazer behaviour and is what
 *   made heavy-SV maps render incorrectly.
 *
 * To position notes correctly even across speed changes, we integrate speed
 * over time into a cumulative "scroll distance" D(t). A note at time T sits at
 * (D(T) - D(now)) distance from the judgement line; both endpoints of a long
 * note are positioned the same way, so SV stretches/compresses them naturally.
