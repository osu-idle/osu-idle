/**
 * How a level is drawn, everywhere in the game. One place on purpose: these
 * rules are easy to lose track of, and a level that renders differently in one
 * screen reads as a bug.
 *
 * 1. Colour comes from the ramp in shared.css, `.level_100` .. `.level_110`.
 * 2. Past the top of the ramp a level keeps its last colour. It must never fall
 *    through to no colour at all - the effective level runs well past 110.
 * 3. Under the bottom of the ramp a level is a plain number and takes its colour
 *    from whatever contains it.
 * 4. Progress inside the level trails as decimals, faded in proportion to it,
 *    and only once the level is on the ramp.
