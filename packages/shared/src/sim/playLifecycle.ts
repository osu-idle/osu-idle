/**
 * The client-side life of a play, from "running" to a result on screen.
 *
 * This is a pure reducer: it never touches the clock, the socket, the audio or
 * React. It takes an event and returns the next state plus the effects the
 * caller should carry out. That is the point - every ending a play can have
 * (the song running out, a fail, a debug skip, a skip whose replay never
 * arrives, a server result, a server that will not answer, a quit) is reachable
 * in a unit test without a browser.
 *
 * The invariants it exists to hold, each of which was previously spread across
 * the scene and broken one ending at a time:
 *
 *  - a play releases the audio and freezes the playfield exactly once
 *  - a play shows exactly one result, and always shows one
 *  - a terminal phase ignores everything that arrives late
 *  - a skip cannot sit forever: the replay either arrives or times out, and
 *    both go to the same place
 */

/**
 * How the play is scored, which decides who owns its result.
 *
 * Only `debug` scores itself. Every other play is resolved up front by someone
 * else - the server for `ranked`, the local session for `guest` and `unranked` -
 * and the scene asks that owner for the result rather than deciding one. That is
 * what lets a play keep running while nobody is watching it.
